## Open Beehives project review

For some months I've been interested in open source projects mainly because right now I'm enrolled in a Open source software course on my university. Not that I've never been interested before this course, it's just that this course have inspired me to dive deep into the open source philosophy.

One project that has caught my attention is a project called [Open Source Beehives](http://www.opensourcebeehives.net/), this project among some of the new wave of Open Source projects(I like to call them Internet of things projects) has some special feature, more than working on the digital sphere this projects trascend to the real life and palpable things.

Open source Beehives's mission is simple, save the honeybees by building a data set of honeybees behaviour information for scientific and preservation research, and they do it by building a network of sensors around the world placed on the beehives of people that want to contribute to this project... sound simple right?. In fact it is a simple as it sounds OSBeehives have different components that build the entire project collaboration method, the standard sketch is:

1.Beekeeping


2.Beehives

3.Sensorkits

4.Software App

5.Data science
